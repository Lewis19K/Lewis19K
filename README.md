# üí´ About Me:
Hi there! üëã I'm Luis Corrales  
I'm a Civil Engineer in Computer Science with experience in software development, virtual reality, and creating tools to optimize game development workflows. I enjoy solving complex problems and am passionate about learning new technologies while continuously improving my skills.

Thanks to the comprehensive education I received at UTFSM, I have developed knowledge across various areas of computer science through numerous university projects. My experiences include a software development internship, where I enhanced my skills in creating efficient solutions, and a Business Intelligence internship, where I worked on BPMN modeling and documenting processes for ERP migration. Additionally, for fun, I have developed video games and Discord bots on my own. This combination of academic training, hands-on experience, and personal projects has provided me with a diverse skill set and a strong foundation in software engineering.
